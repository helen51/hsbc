The project contains basically three layers, entity, repository and service.

#### entity
For entity layer, there are three entities, User, Role and Token.
User entity consists of userName, encrypted password and a set of roles.
Role entity consists of roleName;
Token entity consists of tokenName and expiredTime;

#### repository
For repository layer, there are four tables, User, Role, Token and TokenUser.
User table stores user info: userName, encrypted password and set of roles assigned to the user.
Role table stores role info: roleName;
Token table stores token info:  tokenName and expiredTime.
TokenUser table stores the relationship between user and token using userName and tokenName. This is a 1-on-1 mapping.

* createUser - create user for input userName and password
